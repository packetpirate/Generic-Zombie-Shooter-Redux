# Grave Wave
Grave Wave began as a remake to my first game, Generic Zombie Shooter, from 2013. It is a top-down zombie shooter with a dark vaporwave aesthetic.

However, this project has become far too large and so much more than a remake that it has become something entirely different.

Today marks 2 years since I began development on Grave Wave. As such, I have renamed the project to dissociate it from the game is was originally intended to be a remake of.

The game is currently undergoing a massive visual overhaul. I am also rewriting the core game mechanics, as the final game will still be wave-based, but will have many new elements, such as levels and dialog.
